<h1> Similarities in D3 Layouts </h1>
<p>The main layout similarity is just the way you create the different graphs. First you get a dataset and use that dataset to set up your 
graph with the d3 algorithm. The similarity in the d3 algorithm is mainly what i noticed in the reading. Each graph needs to define what it 
is first, a pie chart, force chart or the stacked charts. And then you would be able to bind the dataset and use what you know about the dataset
to define how you want the graph to look. For example a force chart dataset is different than a pie chart dataset. Using the various .attr 
links, you can create whatever looking graph you'd like constricting to the values you have and type of graph you chose to use. Each and every
one of the graphs need multiple d3.core algorithms to create the graph- they are basically needed to have one of them create the graph and the other
to add more onto that graph, for example, using a stack graph requires you to group certain parts of a dataset and the second d3 algorithm would
actually create the visual with the broken up dataset. </p>
